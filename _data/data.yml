    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Software engineer with experience from running and developing large scale distributed systems in Microsoft.
      Interested in information retrieval, performance, databases and distributed systems.
      In my current role I have been doing service migrations, A/B experiments, performance and reliability improvements in a service that provides feed-like APIs.

    info:
      - role: Software Engineer, Software Engineer 2
        time: 2020 - Present
        company: Microsoft Develoment Center Norway, Trondheim/Remote
        details: |
          In my time in Microsoft I have been working in two teams.
          The first team owns services responsible for ingesting billions of documents and data into a proprietary cloud for content to become searchable and used in a large set of client experiences within Office 365.
          My work here was about moving a distributed system from old and outdated hardware to an Azure Worker role for reduced COGS and performance.

          In my current team I have been responsible for A/B experimentation in relation to a large scale service migration. New service serves a few hundred million requests per day with increased relevancy and user engagement.
          Other noteworthy impact has been moving a service to Azure, caching, backend part of infinite scroll and query planning.
          In both teams I have been striving to improve team culture and diversity and inclusion by doing interviews.

      - role: Software Engineer
        time: 2019 - 2020
        company: Busy, Remote
        details: |
          In Busy I had a full-stack role which involved frontend development with React, backend development with node.js express, android development using Kotlin and I also touched upon the various types of data storage we used (firebase, PostgreSQL).
          My primary impact on Busy was my contributions for the firebase to SQL migration, and how to solve that without taking too much risk. Other noteworthy impact of my time there was SQL query optimization, contributing to the android app and doing the proof of concept on aggregated statistics.

      - role: Software Engineer Intern
        time: 2019 - 2019
        company: Microsoft Development Center Norway, Trondheim
        details: |
          During this internship I was set in charge of making scaling of a complex distributed system running more than 10k machines on average, more robust.
          The outcome was a scaling strategy which prevented scale-in in situations where the limiting resource of the workers was different than what the old strategies looked at.
